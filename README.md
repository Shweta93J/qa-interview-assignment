# QA Automation Assessment Submission

This repo contains my end-to-end submission for a QA automation assignment. I kept the structure simple and review-friendly.

## Contents
- `ui-automation/` - Playwright (TypeScript) UI automation using Page Object Model + external test data
- `api-tests/` - Postman collection for Petstore (POST + GET) with validations
- `manual-test-cases/` - 5 high-value manual test cases for Demo Web Shop
- `bonus/` - Short note on how I used AI tools responsibly during development

## Quick Start
If you're mainly reviewing UI automation:
1. Open `ui-automation/README.md`
2. Run the tests and view the HTML report

Notes:
- No personal credentials are stored in the repo.
- Any optional values (like a demo user) are read from environment variables.
